### Comprehensive Review of the Codebase

#### 1. **Project Structure**
- The structure is modular and clear, with separation of core, plugins, middleware, routes, and utils.
- No unnecessary files or clutter.

---

#### 2. **Core Files Review**

##### `src/core/server.js`
- **Correctness:** Sets up Fastify with a health check route.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Should support dynamic plugin/route registration (currently only a static health check).
  - Should allow for middleware and error handler registration.

##### `src/core/logger.js`
- **Correctness:** Uses Pino for logging, supports pretty print.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Should allow for more advanced transports (file, external, etc.) via config.
  - Should ensure logger is used everywhere (including router, plugins, etc.).

##### `src/core/plugins.js`
- **Correctness:** Dynamically loads plugins from a config.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Should validate plugin existence before requiring.
  - Should support async plugin loading and error propagation.

##### `src/core/adapter.js`
- **Correctness:** Provides a solid base class for adapters, with request, URL building, and health check.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Should support OAuth2/JWT out of the box for commerce adapters.
  - Should allow for custom error handling and retry logic.
  - Should support multiple hosts (for load balancing/failover).

##### `src/core/aggregators.js`
- **Correctness:** Implements common aggregation strategies as Fastify plugins.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Should allow for custom aggregators via config.
  - Should document available aggregators for plugin authors.

##### `src/core/router.js`
- **Correctness:** 
  - Loads config, registers endpoints, supports hot-reload with chokidar.
  - Uses axios for backend calls.
- **Issues:**
  - **Does not unregister old routes on config reload** (can lead to duplicate/conflicting routes).
  - **Does not support aggregation** if multiple backends are defined for an endpoint.
  - **Does not support per-endpoint validation** (schema enforcement).
  - **Does not support extra_config features** (rate limiting, circuit breaker, transforms, etc.).
  - **Directly uses Fastify instance inside the module** (should be injected for testability and modularity).
  - **Does not support YAML config** (only JSON).
  - **Does not use the Adapter/Plugin system for backend calls** (calls axios directly).
- **Enhancements:**
  - Refactor to use injected Fastify instance.
  - Use the Adapter system for backend calls.
  - Support aggregation, validation, and extra_config features.
  - Unregister old routes on reload.
  - Support YAML config.

##### `src/core/index.js`
- **Correctness:** Exports core functions.
- **Enhancements:** None needed.

---

#### 3. **Utils**

##### `src/utils/errorHandler.js`
- **Correctness:** Simple error handler.
- **Enhancements:** 
  - Should log errors.
  - Should support error codes and stack traces in development.

---

#### 4. **Plugins, Middleware, Routes**
- **Plugins:** Directory exists but is empty. Should contain adapters for Shopify, CommerceTools, etc.
- **Middleware:** Directory exists but is empty. Should contain auth, CORS, rate limiting, etc.
- **Routes:** Only a v1 directory, but no files. All routing is currently dynamic.

---

#### 5. **Main Entry (`commercex.js`)**
- **Correctness:** Loads logger, server, plugins, and starts Fastify.
- **Issues:**
  - Expects `config.plugins` and `config.server.port`, but config uses `endpoints` and `port`.
  - Does not load or register dynamic routes from config.
  - Does not handle hot-reload at the top level.
- **Enhancements:**
  - Should load and register routes using the router module.
  - Should handle config reloads and propagate changes to the server.

---

#### 6. **Config (`config/commercex.json`)**
- **Correctness:** Follows KrakenD format.
- **Enhancements:** 
  - Should be validated against the KrakenD schema at runtime.
  - Should support both JSON and YAML.

---

### **Summary of Issues and Recommendations**

#### **Critical Issues**
- Router does not unregister old routes on reload.
- Router does not use the Adapter/Plugin system for backend calls.
- Main entry does not register dynamic routes or handle hot-reload.
- No schema validation for config or requests.
- No support for extra_config features (rate limiting, circuit breaker, etc.).

#### **Enhancements**
- Refactor router to:
  - Use injected Fastify instance.
  - Use Adapter system for backend calls.
  - Support aggregation, validation, and extra_config.
  - Unregister old routes on reload.
  - Support YAML config.
- Implement plugin/adapters for commerce backends.
- Implement middleware for CORS, auth, rate limiting, etc.
- Add config and request schema validation.
- Improve error handling and logging.
- Add tests for all core modules.

---

### **Next Steps**

Would you like to proceed with a systematic refactor, starting with the router and main entry, or focus on a specific area first (e.g., adapters, middleware, validation)?
