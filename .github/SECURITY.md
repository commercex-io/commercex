## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our codebase seriously. If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Do not disclose the vulnerability publicly**
2. **Email us at [security@example.com](mailto:security@example.com)** with a detailed description of the vulnerability
3. Include steps to reproduce the vulnerability if possible
4. We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
5. We will provide an estimated timeline for a fix and keep you updated on progress

## Security Measures

- We regularly update dependencies to patch known vulnerabilities
- We employ automated code scanning tools to detect security issues
- All code changes undergo security review before being merged
- We follow security best practices in our development process

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we appreciate security researchers who report vulnerabilities responsibly and may offer recognition for significant findings.
